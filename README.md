## Summary
In summary, the improvements to the filtering options for the website allow for more detailed and specific searches of the UFO data to potentially identify patterns or notable inconsistencies. This information could eventually be useful in finally answering the question of if there is indeed intelligent life is out there ([Enrico Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) would like a word with all you believers, by the way).

It should be noted that the removal of the button that triggers the filtering of the data table removes a discrete and intentional event that changes the table as visualized on the webpage. A typo or data entered in the incorrect format will empty the table of all content as there are no matches, and no error checks on the filter fields. In the future, it would be optimal to incorporate a series of error pop-ups that indicate where a piece of data has not be correctly entered. In addition, because there is no persistent output for the website, it would be a nice option to allow a user to download filtered results as a .csv file if they would like to save their filtered tables and perform additional analyses.
